# QUEUE - task-queue index (single writer: Claude Code)

Format: `<status> | <file> | <one-line scope> | <notes>`
Statuses: DRAFT / QUEUED / DISPATCHED / AWAITING-REVIEW / LANDED <sha> / BOUNCED
(protocol in README.md)

## Active

(nothing dispatched - Seth smokes the U10/U8/U9 wave on the staging Vercel
deploy of `d21608c`, then the analytics-engine -> main merge decision)

## Candidates (next units, not yet authored as blocks)

- A5 exercise picker (UI, Cursor-suited once A4 FK design is done)
- A6 name-resolution backfill/aliasing (Cursor-suited, needs A4 first)
- T3 dynamic loading screens (UI, file-disjoint from Track A -> a natural
  first Mode 2 parallel pair once designed)
- NOT queueable: A1 catalog merge (gated migration, Seth manual), A4 FK
  schema design (Claude-tier planning, not a Cursor unit)

## Landed

- LANDED d21608c | u10-home-hero-dead-space.md | home layout fix (align-content: start) + weekly-report set-count formatting | Cursor ran U10/U8/U9 in ONE working tree (against the serialized-dispatch plan) - reviewed and committed together; reviewer added the rounded-delta tone fix
- LANDED d21608c | u8-volume-trend-strength-sparklines.md | volume Bars|Trend|Table small multiples + strength e1RM sparklines | reviewer fixes: sparkline dots as non-scaling round-cap strokes (circles stretched to ellipses under preserveAspectRatio=none), single-session dot centered + no duplicate value, mvt last-week label moved to a fixed third grid column (was overflowing the card edge)
- LANDED d21608c | u9-execution-legibility-balance-polish.md | execution verdict + planned-vs-did line; balance zone band + ghost tracks | reviewer fixes: weight formatting in formatPlanActual failed the block's own acceptance string ("100.0 lbs" vs "100 lbs"), newsy verdict clauses now outrank on-plan filler, sub-rep effort drift no longer reads "stopped ~0 reps early"

- LANDED f22989d | u7-home-weekly-report.md | weekly report band on Home (last-7-days vs prior-7-days, under the hero) | review clean (build re-run, no-hex grep, sessions endpoint unlimited); Seth smoked it July 3 on staging - band accepted, two layout/formatting critiques spun off as U10
- LANDED c7acb43 | b9-analytics-time-series.md | weekly volume series + per-session e1RM series + execution planned/actual summaries | reviewer tightened the inclusive-end bucket assertion; 103/103 unit lane
- LANDED 00c67dc | b8-rpe-effort-pooling.md | RPE pooled with RIR as one effort signal engine-wide
- LANDED d4b1d72 | u6-weight-unit-pref.md | lbs/kg display pref in log prefs + analytics
